.SH NAME
jailtest \- Simple utility program to test running sandboxes
.SH SYNOPSIS
sudo jailtest [OPTIONS] [directory]
.SH DESCRIPTION
WORK IN PROGRESS!
jailtest attaches itself to all sandboxes started by the user and performs some basic tests
on the sandbox filesystem:
.TP
\fB1. Virtual directories
jailtest extracts a list with the main virtual directories installed by the sandbox.
These directories are build by firejail at startup using --private* and --whitelist commands.
.TP
\fB2. Noexec test
jailtest inserts executable programs in /home/username, /tmp, and /var/tmp directories
and tries to run them form inside the sandbox, thus testing if the directory is executable or not.
.TP
\fB3. Read access test
jailtest creates test files in the directories specified by the user and tries to read
them from inside the sandbox.

.TP
The program is running as root exclusively under sudo.
